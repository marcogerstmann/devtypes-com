Is it true that you don’t get all the things done in one workday you wanted to get done? It could be because you are distracted by things that are in a so called “inbox”. “Inbox Zero” will help you with that.</p>\n<p>You probably already know what an inbox is. However, it is important to have a precise definition in mind.</p>\n<p>My own <strong>definition of an inbox</strong>: a storage for entries that have not yet been rated and prioritized.</p>\n<p>That’s already my whole definition. So first of all, an inbox is nothing to be distracted from as soon as new entries appear there.</p>\n<p>And yet we all tend to see inbox entries as instant call-to-actions.</p>\n<p>The problem here is that an immediate reaction to new inbox entries leads to the fact that the actual planned activity is interrupted, which significantly reduces productivity.</p>\n<p>In the text below I describe how you can use “Inbox Zero” to gain more clarity and focus so that you can concentrate on the important activities.</p>\n<h2>Types of inboxes</h2>\n<p>What comes to mind first when you hear “Inbox”? For me it is a box in which everything that is supposed to reach you ends up unsorted.</p>\n<p>Seen digitally, the first thing that comes to mind is the email inbox. Different types of inbox entries end up there, such as personal letters, business letters, alert emails, newsletters and ads.</p>\n<p>But there are a number of other types of inboxes. First of all, you should define for yourself which inboxes exist in your private and professional life. That varies depending on the person and position. That’s why I give you the main inboxes for my everyday work:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Email inbox</li>\n<li>Chat inbox (Slack)</li>\n<li>To-do list inbox (Todoist)</li>\n<li>Project management inbox (Pivotal Tracker, but can also be Jira for instance)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>All new emails that have been sent to me end up in my <strong>email inbox</strong>.</p>\n<p>All messages addressed to me end up in my <strong>chat inbox</strong>.</p>\n<p>All the to-do entries that I have created for myself (e.g. manually or converted from emails) end up in my <strong>to-do list inbox</strong>.</p>\n<p>All new entries of our software project end up in our <strong>project management inbox</strong>, e.g. bug reports, new feature ideas, refactoring ideas and other project-related entries.</p>\n<p>Now take a sheet of paper and a pen and write down which inboxes you can define for your everyday life. Also write down what types of entries you get there.</p>\n<h2>Actions for inbox entries</h2>\n<p>There are different actions for the different types of inboxes that you can perform on their entries. You can roughly divide them all into the following five types of action:</p>\n<h3>1. Delete / archive</h3>\n<p>If the entry is not useful at all, you should delete it immediately (for instance spam and advertising). If the entry contains information you may need in the future, archive it.</p>\n<p>Email clients usually have functions for tagging, archiving and moving to other folders. Similar functions are also available for to-do list apps and project management apps.</p>\n<h3>2. Delegate</h3>\n<p>If you have an inbox entry that you shouldn’t or cannot do by yourself, delegate it to someone else, for example by forwarding an email with a short note. Then delete or archive the entry.</p>\n<h3>3. Snooze</h3>\n<p>This means setting the entry so that it appears again at a later time (because you may still lack information or you may have to wait for someone else). Do not leave such an entry in the inbox, but make sure that you are reminded again at another time.</p>\n<p>You can often snooze an email with one click, so that it later reappears in your inbox. For other types of entries, you could write a reminder and then archive it.</p>\n<h3>4. Create to-do entry</h3>\n<p>If the entry is not already an entry in your to-do inbox, you could also create a to-do entry from it.</p>\n<p>In principle, you only transfer one inbox element to another inbox type, but you can specify the order of processing within your to-do list.</p>\n<h3>5. Execute</h3>\n<p>This means that you immediately start doing the task contained in the inbox element.</p>\n<p>This is only advisable if it doesn’t take longer than two minutes of your time. If the direct execution takes longer, write a to-do entry and order it after your more important tasks.</p>\n<h2>The Inbox Zero daily routine</h2>\n<p>Now you know which inboxes there are in your everyday life and what you can do with the incoming entries. The only thing that is still missing is a simple system with which you can effectively process your inboxes every day in order to achieve “Inbox Zero” once a day.</p>\n<p>This system is very simple and has only three steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Close your inboxes when you’re focused on a task.</li>\n<li>Check your inboxes 1-3 times a day at specified times.</li>\n<li>Try to empty your inboxes completely.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There are no more steps to Inbox Zero. Let’s go through them one by one in more detail.</p>\n<h3>1. Close your inboxes when you’re focused on a task.</h3>\n<p>This point is particularly important. After all, you want to be more productive with “Inbox Zero”.</p>\n<p>Ideally, you already know at the beginning of your day what you want to have achieved at the end of the day (for example, prioritized by your to-do list). This goal can usually only be achieved if you can work on it in a focused and uninterrupted manner.</p>\n<p>So close all your inboxes and make sure that you are not disturbed from your time of concentrated work.</p>\n<h3>2. Check your inboxes 1-3 times a day at specified times.</h3>\n<p>You should check your inboxes <strong>daily</strong>. But that doesn’t mean you have to keep checking them <strong>all the time</strong>.</p>\n<p>Try to find the lowest possible frequency at which you need to control your inboxes. Ideally, this is <strong>once a day</strong>.</p>\n<p>However, since we are always expected to have “permanent availability” and quick response rates, I can understand that this goal is not realistic, at least for some types of inboxes.</p>\n<p>For just a few inboxes, choose a higher frequency. For example, check your emails three times a day (in the morning, after lunch, and one hour before work ends).</p>\n<p>Only in exceptional cases should you choose more than three times a day. Maybe because you are a server administrator and have to react immediately to server failures. In this case, make sure that the server alerts only arrive in a single inbox intended for only this purpose.</p>\n<h3>3. Try to empty your inboxes completely.</h3>\n<p>While you check your inboxes, your goal is to completely empty them to reach Inbox Zero.</p>\n<p><strong>During this time, this is your only task, which you focus on with full concentration.</strong></p>\n<p>Act only with the five actions for inbox entries presented above.</p>\n<p>As soon as you have checked and completely emptied your inbox, close it again and devote yourself to your daily tasks without any disruptive factors.</p>","excerpt":"Are you a product manager or a leading software engineer?
